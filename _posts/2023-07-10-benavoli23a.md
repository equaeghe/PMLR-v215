title: Closure operators, classifiers and desirability
abstract: At the core of Bayesian probability theory, or dually desirability theory,
  lies an assumption of linearity of the scale in which rewards are measured. We revisit
  two recent papers that extend desirability theory to the nonlinear case by letting
  the utility scale be represented either by a general closure operator or by a binary
  general (nonlinear) classifier. By using standard results in logic, we highlight
  the connection between these two approaches and show that this connection allows
  us to extend the separating hyper plane theorem (which is at the core of the duality
  between Bayesian decision theory and desirability theory) to the nonlinear case.
