title: Uncertainty propagation using copulas in a 3D stereo matching pipeline
abstract: This contribution presents a concrete example of uncertainty propagation
  in a stereo matching pipeline. It considers the problem of matching pixels between
  pairs of images whose radiometry is uncertain and modeled by possibility distributions.
  Copulas serve as dependency models between variables and are used to propagate the
  imprecise models. The propagation steps are detailed in the simple case of the Sum
  of Absolute Difference cost function for didactic purposes. The method results in
  an imprecise matching cost curve. To reduce computation time, a sufficient condition
  for conserving possibility distributions after the propagation is also presented.
  Finally, results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations, indicating that the
  method produces envelopes capable of correctly estimating the matching cost.
