title: On distinct belief functions in the Dempster-Shafer theory
abstract: 'Dempster’s combination rule is the centerpiece of the Dempster-Shafer (D-S)
  theory of belief functions. In practice, Dempster’s combination rule should only
  be applied to combine two distinct belief functions (in the belief function literature,
  distinct belief functions are also called independent belief functions). So, the
  question arises: what constitutes distinct belief functions? We have an answer in
  Dempster’s multi-valued functions semantics for distinct belief functions. The probability
  functions on the two spaces associated with the multi-valued functions should be
  independent. In practice, however, we don’t always associate a multi-valued function
  with belief functions in a model. In this article, we discuss the notion of distinct
  belief functions in graphical models, both directed and undirected. The idea of
  distinct belief functions corresponds to no double-counting of non-idempotent knowledge
  semantics of conditional independence. Although we discuss the notion of distinct
  belief functions in the context of the DS theory, the discussion is valid more broadly
  to many uncertainty calculi, including probability theory, possibility theory, and
  Spohn’s epistemic belief theory.'
