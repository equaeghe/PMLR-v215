title: Sublinear expectations for countable-state uncertain processes
abstract: Sublinear expectations for uncertain processes have received a lot of attention
  recently, particularly methods to extend a downward-continuous sublinear expectation
  on the bounded finitary functions to one on the non-finitary functions. In most
  of the approaches the domain of the extension is not very rich because it is limited
  to bounded measurable functions on the set of all paths. This contribution alleviates
  this problem in the countable-state case by extending, under a mild condition, to
  the extended real measurable functions on the set of càdlàg paths, and investigates
  when a sublinear Markov semigroup induces a sublinear expectation that satisfies
  this mild condition.
