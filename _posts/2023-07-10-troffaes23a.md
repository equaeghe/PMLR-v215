title: A nonstandard approach to stochastic processes under probability bounding
abstract: This paper studies stochastic processes under probability bounding, using
  nonstandard conditional lower previsions within the framework of internal set theory.
  Following Nelsonâ€™s approach to stochastic processes, we introduce elementary processes
  which are defined over a finite number of time points and that serve to approximate
  any standard process, including processes over continuous time. We show that every
  standard process can be represented by an elementary process, and that the shadow
  of every elementary process constitutes again a standard process. We then move to
  demonstrate how elementary processes can be used to define imprecise Markov chains
  both in discrete and continuous time. To demonstrate the benefits and downsides
  of this approach, we show how to recover some basic results for continuous time
  Markov chains through analysis of a nonstandard elementary process.
