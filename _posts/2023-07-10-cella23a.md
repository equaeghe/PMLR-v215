title: Finite sample valid probabilistic inference on quantile regression
abstract: In most applications, uncertainty quantification in quantile regression
  take the form of set estimates for the regression coefficients. However, often a
  more informative type of uncertainty quantification is desired where other inference-related
  tasks can be performed, such as the assignment of (imprecise) probabilities to assertions
  of interest about (any feature of) the regression coefficients. Validity of these
  probabilities, in the sense that their values are well-calibrated in a frequentist
  sense, is fundamental to the trustworthiness of the drawn conclusions. This paper
  presents a nonparametric Inferential Model (IM) construction that offers provably
  valid probabilistic uncertainty quantification in quantile regression, even in finite
  sample settings. It is also shown that this IM can be used to derive finite sample
  confidence regions for (any feature of) the regression coefficients. As a result,
  regardless of the type of uncertainty quantification desired, the proposed IM offers
  an appealing solution to quantile regression problems.
