title: Open world Dempster-Shafer using complementary sets
abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) is a mathematical framework to handle imprecision
  and uncertainty in reasoning and decision making. One assumption of DST is that
  of a closed-world, or the assumption that all propositions are known <em>a priori</em>.
  In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of Dempster-Shafer that allows
  for the dynamic inclusion of new propositions. Specifically, we expand the framework
  to include the complement of every set of propositions. This adjustment enables
  an open-world interpretation that can support unspecified and dynamic propositions
  as we learn about the problem space. Including complementary sets distinguishes
  this from previous work in DST where the open world is attributed to the empty set.
  We demonstrate our open world Dempster-Shafer Theory on a variety of synthetic and
  real datasets.
