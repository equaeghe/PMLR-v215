title: On the relationship between graphical and compositional models for the Dempster-Shafer
  theory of belief functions
abstract: This paper studies the relationship between graphical and compositional
  models representing joint belief functions. In probability theory, the class of
  Bayesian networks (directed graphical models) is equivalent to compositional models.
  Such an equivalence does not hold for the Dempster-Shafer belief function theory.
  We show that each directed graphical belief function model can be represented as
  a compositional model, but the converse does not hold. As there are two composition
  operators for belief functions, there are two types of compositional models. In
  studying their relation to graphical models, they are closely connected. Namely,
  one is more specific than the other. A precise relationship between these two composition
  operators is described.
