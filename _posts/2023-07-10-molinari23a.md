title: 'Trust the evidence: two deference principles for imprecise probabilities'
abstract: Our intuition that rational agents should value the evidence can be captured
  by a well-known theorem due to I. J. Good. However, Good’s theorem fails when agents
  have imprecise credences, raising the worry that agents with imprecise credences
  don’t value the evidence. This essay shows a different way to capture our starting
  intuition, as the claim that rational agents defer to their informed selves. I introduce
  and motivate two deference principles for imprecise probabilities, and show that
  rational imprecise agents defer to their informed selves according to these principles.
  This shows a sense in which imprecise agents value the evidence. I end by comparing
  the deference principles introduced here with an alternative from the literature.
