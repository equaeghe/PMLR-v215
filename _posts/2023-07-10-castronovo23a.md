title: A generalized notion of conjunction for two conditional events
abstract: Traditionally the conjunction of conditional events has been defined as
  a three-valued object. However, in this way classical logical and probabilistic
  properties are not preserved. In recent literature, a notion of conjunction of two
  conditional events as a suitable conditional random quantity, which satisfies classical
  probabilistic properties, has been deepened in the setting of coherence. In this
  framework the conjunction $(A|H) \wedge (B|K)$ of two conditional events $A|H$ and
  $B|K$ is defined as a five-valued object with set of possible values $\{1,0,x,y,z\}$,
  where $x=P(A|H), y=P(B|K)$, and $z=\mathbb{P}[(A|H) \wedge (B|K)]$. In this paper
  we propose a generalization of this object, denoted by $(A|H) \wedge_{a,b} (B|K)$,
  where the values $x$ and $y$ are replaced by two arbitrary values $a,b \in [0,1]$.
  Then, by means of a geometrical approach, we compute the set of all coherent assessments
  on the family $\{A|H,B|K,(A|H) \wedge_{a,b} (B|K)\}$, by also showing that in the
  general case the Fr√©chet-Hoeffding bounds for the conjunction are not satisfied.
  We also analyze some particular cases. Finally, we study coherence in the imprecise
  case of an interval-valued probability assessment and we consider further aspects
  on $(A|H) \wedge_{a,b} (B|K)$.
