title: Robust possibilistic production planning under temporal demand uncertainty
  with knowledge on dependencies
abstract: 'In this paper, we deal with production planning problem under temporal
  demand uncertainty. More precisely, a demand forecasting for a given period could
  move backward in time or forward in time. We investigate the case where knowledge
  on dependencies on demand is available. This knowledge is taken into account through
  a family of copula function. The aim results of the paper are: (a) this approach
  do not increase the complexity of production planning problem, (b) limit the conservatism
  of fuzzy robust approach for production planning problem and evaluates more precisely
  the necessity that the cost of a production plan does not exceed a certain threshold.'
