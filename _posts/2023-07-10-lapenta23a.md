title: The logic FP(Ł,Ł) and two-sorted equational states
abstract: The logic {FP(Ł{},Ł)} was introduced by L. Godo and T. Flaminio as an expansion
  of {Ł}ukasiewicz logic with a modality, to reason about the probability of vague
  events. We prove that {FP(Ł{},Ł)} is complete with respect to a class of two-sorted
  algebras, called <em>equational states</em>. They are an equational presentation
  of the well-known theory of states over lattice ordered groups.
