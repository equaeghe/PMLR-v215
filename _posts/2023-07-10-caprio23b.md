title: Constriction for sets of probabilities
abstract: Given a set of probability measures $\mathcal{P}$ representing an agent’s
  knowledge on the elements of a sigma-algebra $\mathcal{F}$, we can compute upper
  and lower bounds for the probability of any event $A\in\mathcal{F}$ of interest.
  A procedure generating a new assessment of beliefs is said to constrict $A$ if the
  bounds on the probability of $A$ after the procedure are contained in those before
  the procedure. It is well documented that (generalized) Bayes’ updating does not
  allow for constriction, for all $A\in\mathcal{F}$. In this work, we show that constriction
  can take place with and without evidence being observed, and we characterize these
  possibilities.
