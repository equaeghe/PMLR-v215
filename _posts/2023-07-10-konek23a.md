title: Evaluating imprecise forecasts
abstract: This paper will introduce a new class of IP scoring rules for sets of almost
  desirable gambles. A set of almost desirable gambles $\mathcal{D}$ is evaluable
  for what might be called generalised type 1 and type 2 error. Generalised type 1
  error is roughly a matter of the extent to which $\mathcal{D}$ encodes false judgments
  of desirability. Generalised type 2 error is roughly a matter of the extent to which
  $\mathcal{D}$ fails to encode true judgments of desirability. IP scoring rules are
  penalty functions that average these two types of error. To demonstrate the viability
  of IP scoring rules, we must show that for any coherent $\mathcal{D}$ you might
  choose, we can construct an IP scoring rule that renders it admissible. Moreover,
  every other admissible model relative to that scoring rule is also coherent. This
  paper makes progress toward that goal. We will also compare the class of scoring
  rules developed here with the results by Seidenfeld, Schervish, and Kadane from
  2012,which establish that there is no strictly proper, continuous real-valued scoring
  rule for lower and upper probability forecasts.
