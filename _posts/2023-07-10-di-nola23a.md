title: A pointfree approach to measurability and statistical models
abstract: In this work we approach the problem of finding the most <em>natural</em>
  algebraic structure of the set of all possible random variables on a measurable
  space, inspired by Nelsonâ€™s point of view. We build our work on previous papers
  by the same authors and set our investigation in the framework of MV-algebras and
  algebraic logic. We approach the problem from the perspective of pointfree topology,
  in order to take the notion of random variable as the primitive one. In the final
  part of the paper we approach statistical models from the point of view of algebra
  and category theory, providing a different and perhaps more insightful justification
  for our logico-algebraic approach to the notion.
