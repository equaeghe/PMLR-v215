title: Learning calibrated belief functions from conformal predictions
abstract: We consider the problem of supervised classification. We focus on the problem
  of calibrating the classifier’s outputs. We show that the p-values provided by Inductive
  Conformal Prediction (ICP) can be interpreted as a possibility distribution over
  the set of classes. This allows us to use ICP to compute a predictive belief function
  which is calibrated by construction. We also propose a learning method which provides
  p-values in a simpler and faster way, by making use of a multi-output regression
  model. Results obtained on the Cifar10 and Digits data sets show that our approach
  is comparable to standard ICP in terms of accuracy and calibration, while offering
  a reduced complexity and avoiding the use of a calibration set.
