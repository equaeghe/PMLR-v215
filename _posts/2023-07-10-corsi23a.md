title: 'A modal logic for uncertainty: a completeness theorem'
abstract: In the present paper, we axiomatize a logic that allows a general approach
  for reasoning about probability functions, belief functions, lower probabilities
  and their corresponding duals. The formal setting we consider arises from combining
  a modal S5 necessity operator $\Box$ that applies to the formulas of the infinite-valued
  {Ł}ukasiewicz logic with the unary modality $P$ that describes the behaviour of
  probability functions. The modality $P$ together with an S5 {modality} $\Box$ provides
  a language rich enough to characterise probability, belief and lower probability
  theories. For this logic, we provide an axiomatization and we prove that, once we
  restrict to suitable sublanguages, it turns out to be sound and complete with respect
  to belief functions and lower probability models.
