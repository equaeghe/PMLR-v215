title: Markov conditions and factorization in logical credal networks
abstract: We examine the recently proposed language of <em>Logical Credal Networks</em>,
  in particular investigating the consequences of various Markov conditions. We introduce
  the notion of structure for a Logical Credal Network and show that a structure without
  directed cycles leads to a well-known factorization result. For networks with directed
  cycles, we analyze the differences between Markov conditions, factorization results,
  and specification requirements.
