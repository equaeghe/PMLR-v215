title: A study of Jeffrey’s rule with imprecise probability models
abstract: Jeffrey’s rule tells us how to update our beliefs about a probability measure
  when we have updated information conditional on some partition of the possibility
  space, while keeping the original marginal information on this partition. It is
  linked to the law of total probability, and is therefore connected to the notion
  of marginal extension of coherent lower previsions. In this paper, we investigate
  its formulation for some other imprecise probability models that are either more
  general (choice functions) or more particular (possibility measures, distortion
  models) than coherent lower previsions.
