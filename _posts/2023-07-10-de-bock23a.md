title: A theory of desirable things
abstract: 'Inspired by the theory of desirable gambles that is used to model uncertainty
  in the field of imprecise probabilities, I present a theory of desirable things.
  Its aim is to model a subject’s beliefs about which things are desirable. What the
  things are is not important, nor is what it means for them to be desirable. It can
  be applied to gambles, calling them desirable if a subject accepts them, but also
  to pizzas, calling them desirable if my friend Arthur likes to eat them. Regardless
  of the particular things that are considered, inference rules are imposed by means
  of an abstract closure operator, and models that adhere to these rules are called
  coherent. I consider two types of models, each of which can capture a subject’s
  beliefs about which things are desirable: sets of desirable things and sets of desirable
  sets of things. A crucial result is that the latter type can be represented by a
  set of the former.'
