title: Towards a strictly frequentist theory of imprecise probability
abstract: 'Strict frequentism defines probability as the limiting relative frequency
  in an infinite sequence. What if the limit does not exist? We present a broader
  theory, which is applicable also to statistical phenomena that exhibit diverging
  relative frequencies. In doing so, we develop a close connection with imprecise
  probability: the cluster points of relative frequencies yield a coherent upper prevision.
  We show that a natural frequentist definition of conditional probability recovers
  the generalized Bayes rule. We prove constructively that, for a finite set of elementary
  events, there exists a sequence for which the cluster points of relative frequencies
  coincide with a prespecified set, thereby providing strictly frequentist semantics
  for coherent upper previsions.'
