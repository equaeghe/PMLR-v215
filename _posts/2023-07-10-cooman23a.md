title: Desirable sets of things and their logic
abstract: We identify the logic behind the recent theory of coherent sets of desirable
  (sets of) things, which generalise coherent sets of desirable (sets of) gambles
  and coherent choice functions, and show that this identification allows us to establish
  various representation results for such coherent models in terms of simpler ones.
