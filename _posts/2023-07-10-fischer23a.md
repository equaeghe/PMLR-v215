title: A comparison between a frequentist, Bayesian and imprecise Bayesian approach
  to delay time maintenance
abstract: Delay time models are stochastic maintenance decision aid tools that divide
  the failure time of a system into the appearance of a defect and its evolution towards
  a breakdown. In this study, an imprecise Bayesian approach to delay time modelling
  has been developed and compared with the frequentist and precise Bayesian approach
  based on a virtual maintenance problem. The conditional failure rate was the unknown
  parameter that had to be estimated via eight samples of failure times of increasing
  size. The goal was to minimise two loss functions related to the downtime and cost.
  The frequentist and precise Bayesian methods converge towards the optimal decision
  as the sample size grows but are strongly sub-optimal when no or only few data are
  available. The imprecise Bayesian approach based on E-admissibility returns large
  decision intervals in the lack of data, thereby straightforwardly representing the
  crucial difference between knowledge and ignorance.
