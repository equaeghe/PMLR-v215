title: Representing suppositional decision theories with sets of desirable gambles
abstract: 'The sets of desirable gambles framework has been well-studied as a tool
  for representing decision-making with imprecise probabilistic beliefs – under the
  assumption of act-state independence. The question of this paper is: can we use
  sets of desirable gambles to represent decisions where the states do depend (e.g.,
  causally or probabilistically) on the acts? In particular, I investigate two possible
  routes for representing suppositional decision theories with sets of desirable gambles,
  concluding that while one route works only for the subclass of SDTs representable
  by general imaging, the other route can represent any SDT whatsoever. After giving
  a fairly flat-footed representation, I investigate whether it’s equivalent to a
  construction directly from the local (suppositional) desirability judgments; it
  isn’t, but this latter construction represents a different aggregation rule applied
  to the same “credal committee.” Finally, I extend the representation to model uncertainty
  about the supposition rule itself, in addition to imprecise credences.'
