title: Imprecision in martingale-theoretic prequential randomness
abstract: In a prequential approach to algorithmic randomness, probabilities for the
  next outcome can be forecast ‘on the fly’ without the need for fully specifying
  a probability measure on all possible sequences of outcomes, as is the case in the
  more standard approach. We take the first steps in allowing for probability intervals
  instead of precise probabilities in this prequential approach, based on ideas from
  our earlier imprecise-probabilistic and martingale-theoretic account of algorithmic
  randomness. We define what it means for an infinite sequence $(I_1,x_1,I_2,x_2,…)$
  of successive interval forecasts $I_k$ and subsequent binary outcomes $x_k$ to be
  random. We compare the resulting prequential randomness notion with the more standard
  one, and investigate where both randomness notions coincide, as well as where their
  properties correspond.
