title: The set structure of precision
abstract: In literature on imprecise probability little attention is paid to the fact
  that imprecise probabilities are precise on some events. We show that this <em>system
  of precision</em> forms, under mild assumptions, a so-called (pre-)Dynkin-system.
  Interestingly, there are several settings, ranging from machine learning on partial
  data over frequential probability theory to quantum probability theory and decision
  making under uncertainty, in which a priori the probabilities are only desired to
  be precise on a specific underlying set system. Here, (pre-)Dynkin-systems have
  been adopted as systems of precision, too. Under extendability conditions those
  pre-Dynkin-systems equipped with probabilities can be embedded into algebras of
  sets. Surprisingly, the extendability conditions elaborated in a strand of work
  in quantum physics are equivalent to coherence. Thus, we link the literature on
  probabilities on pre-Dynkin-systems to the literature on imprecise probability.
  In fact, the system of precision and imprecise probabilities live in structural
  duality.
