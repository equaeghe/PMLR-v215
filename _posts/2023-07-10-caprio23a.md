title: Dynamic precise and imprecise probability kinematics
abstract: We introduce dynamic probability kinematics (DPK), a method for an agent
  to mechanically update subjective beliefs in the presence of partial information.
  We then generalize DPK to dynamic imprecise probability kinematics (DIPK), which
  allows the agent to express their initial beliefs via a set of probabilities in
  order to further take ambiguity into account. Examples are provided to illustrate
  how the methods work.
