title: 'ISIPTA 2023: Preface'
abstract: 'The ISIPTA meetings are the primary international forum for presenting
  and discussing advances in the theory and applications of imprecise probabilities.
  They are organized once every two years by SIPTA, <em>The Society for Imprecise
  Probabilities: Theories and Applications</em>. The first edition took place in Ghent
  in 1999. The 12th edition of 2021, was essentially a virtual event due to the Covid-19
  crisis. The year 2023 marks the return to a full in-person conference. The <em>13th
  International Conference on Imprecise Probabilities: Theories and Applications</em>
  will be held in Oviedo, from Tuesday 11 to Friday 14 July 2023.'
