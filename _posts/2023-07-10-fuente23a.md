title: Sets of probability measures and convex combination spaces
abstract: 'The Wasserstein distances between probability distributions are an important
  tool in modern probability theory which has been generalized to sets of probability
  distributions. We will show that the (generalized) $L^1$-Wasserstein metric, with
  the operations of convolution and rescaling, fits in the abstract framework of convex
  combination spaces: nonlinear metric spaces preserving some of the nice properties
  of a normed space but accomodating other unusual behaviours. For instance, unlike
  in a linear space, a singleton $\{P\}$ is typically not convex (it is so only if
  $P$ is degenerate). Also, some theorems for convex combination spaces are applied
  to this setting.'
