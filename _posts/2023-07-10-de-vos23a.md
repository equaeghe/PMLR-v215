title: Indistinguishability through exchangeability in quantum mechanics?
abstract: Arguments in quantum mechanics often involve systems of indistinguishable
  particles, such as electrons or photons. On the standard approach, the symmetrisation
  postulate is needed to model indistinguishable particles, and results in a theory
  of fermions and bosons. We investigate how indistinguishability can be implemented
  by incorporating structural assessments of symmetry in the sets of desirable measurements
  approach to uncertainty modelling in quantum mechanics, which is based on the theory
  of imprecise probabilities, and in particular on sets of desirable gambles. We show
  that an exchangeability assessment allows us to partially retrieve the concepts
  of fermions and bosons, but that in order to recover the complete fermion and boson
  framework, we need to rely on stronger symmetry assessments. We also lay bare the
  relationship between these stronger assessments and the count vector representation
  for sets of desirable measurements, which we argue corresponds to the commonly used
  second quantisation in quantum mechanics.
