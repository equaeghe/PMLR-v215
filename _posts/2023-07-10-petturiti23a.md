title: No-arbitrage pricing with $α$-DS mixtures in a market with bid-ask spreads
abstract: This paper introduces $\alpha$-DS mixtures, which are normalized capacities
  that can be represented (generally not in a unique way) as the $\alpha$-mixture
  of a belief function and its dual plausibility function. Assuming a finite state
  space, such capacities extend to a Choquet expectation functional that can be given
  a Hurwicz-like expression. In turn, $\alpha$-DS mixtures and their Choquet expectations
  appear to be particularly suitable to model prices in a market with frictions, where
  bid-ask prices are usually averaged taking $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$. For this, we
  formulate a no-arbitrage one-period pricing problem in the framework of $\alpha$-DS
  mixtures and prove the analogues of the first and second fundamental theorems of
  asset pricing. Finally, we perform a calibration on market data to derive a market
  consistent no-arbitrage $\alpha$-DS mixture pricing rule.
