title: Neighbourhood models induced by the Euclidean distance and the Kullback-Leibler
  divergence
abstract: 'Neighbourhood or distortion models are particular imprecise probability
  models that appear by creating a neighbourhood around a probability measure given
  a distorting function and a distortion parameter. This paper investigates the distortion
  models obtained when considering the Euclidean distance or the Kullback-Leibler
  divergence as distorting function. We analyse the main properties of the credal
  sets induced by these two distorting functions as well as the main properties of
  the associated coherent lower previsions. To conclude the paper, we compare these
  two models with other well-known distortion models: the pari-mutuel, linear vacuous,
  constant odds ratio and total variation models.'
