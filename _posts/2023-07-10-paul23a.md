title: 'Expected time averages in Markovian imprecise jump processes: a graph-theoretic
  characterisation of weak ergodicity'
abstract: Markovian imprecise jump processes provide a way to express model uncertainty
  about Markovian jump processes. The dynamics are not governed by a unique rate matrix,
  but are instead partially specified by a set of such matrices. Since the dynamics
  are partially specified, the resulting expected time averages are no longer uniquely
  determined either, and one then resorts to tight lower and upper bounds on them.
  In this paper, we are interested in the existence of an asymptotic limit of these
  upper and lower bounds, as the time horizon becomes infinite. When those limits
  exist and are furthermore independent of the choice of the processâ€™s initial state,
  we say that the process is weakly ergodic. Our main contribution is a necessary
  and sufficient condition for a Markovian imprecise jump process to be weakly ergodic,
  expressed in terms of simple graph-theoretic conditions on its set of rate matrices.
