title: Prime implicants as a versatile tool to explain robust classification
abstract: In this paper, we investigate how robust classification results can be explained
  by the notion of prime implicants, focusing on explaining pairwise dominance relations.
  By robust, we mean that we consider imprecise models that may abstain to classify
  or to compare two classes when information is insufficient. This will be reflected
  by considering (convex) sets of probabilities. By prime implicants, we understand
  a subset of attributes, minimal w.r.t. inclusion, that we need to know or specify
  before reaching a specified conclusion (either of dominance or non-dominance between
  two classes). After presenting the general concepts, we derive them in the case
  of the well-known naive credal classifier.
