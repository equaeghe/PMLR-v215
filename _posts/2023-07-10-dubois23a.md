title: Eliciting hybrid probability-possibility functions and their decision evaluation
  models
abstract: We focus on a decision tree model under uncertainty using so-called hybrid
  probability-possibility functions. They allow to handle behaviours lying between
  possibilistic decision making and probabilistic decision making while keeping the
  good properties of both approaches namely <em>Dynamic Consistency</em>, <em>Consequentialism</em>
  and <em>Tree Reduction</em>. We shed light on the various utility functionals in
  this setting. More precisely, in this paper, we investigate the question of parameterizing
  the compromise between possibilistic and probabilisic models in different contexts.
  To this end, we outline elicitation methods.
