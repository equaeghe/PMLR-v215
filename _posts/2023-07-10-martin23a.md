title: Fiducial inference viewed through a possibility-theoretic inferential model
  lens
abstract: Fisher’s fiducial argument is widely viewed as a failed version of Neyman’s
  theory of confidence limits. But Fisher’s goal—Bayesian-like probabilistic uncertainty
  quantification without priors—was more ambitious than Neyman’s, and it’s not out
  of reach. I’ve recently shown that reliable, prior-free probabilistic uncertainty
  quantification must be grounded in the theory of imprecise probability, and I’ve
  put forward a possibility-theoretic solution that achieves it. This has been met
  with resistance, however, in part due to the statistical community’s singular focus
  on confidence limits. Indeed, if imprecision isn’t needed to answer confidence-limit-related
  questions, then what’s the point? In this paper, for a class of practically useful
  models, I explain specifically why the fiducial argument gives valid confidence
  limits, i.e., it’s the “best probabilistic approximation” of the possibilistic solution
  I recently advanced. This sheds new light on what the fiducial argument is doing
  and on what’s lost in terms of reliability when imprecision is ignored and the fiducial
  argument is pushed for more than just confidence limits.
